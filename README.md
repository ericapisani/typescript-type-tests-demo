# typescript-type-tests-demo

## Setup

- `npm install`

## Running tests

### Unit tests

- `npm run test`

### Type tests

- `npm run type-tsd-test`

**Note:** In the interest of getting this proof of concept up and running, I optimized for using the default configuration of the `tsd` package. As a result, the type definitions files and the associated type test file live in the root directory of the project.
